To start, run ringmaster.py (non-object version)
    RingMaster will communicate on port 5000

Start clients via 'client.py portNum' where portNum is any valid port
Start as many instances as you wish (each instance emulates a device)
Break the chain by killing a process and observe what happens!

TODO:
-tests
-objectifying
-various error-handling strategies at ringmaster startup
-moving simulation to CoAP

future:
-web visualization
